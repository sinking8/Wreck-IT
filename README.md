In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start in client/my-app directory`

Runs client app  in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `nodemon app.js in server directory`

Runs just the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the server in the browser.


### `npm run-script server`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
